Hi, this is a game called Dollars and Cents.

The point of the game is to get as many points as possible. The way to do that is to remove game pieces from a board that keeps adding more pieces as the player plays the game. You get (1 * n) points for pieces removed from the board  where (n) is the amount of times the board was updated after removal  of pieces.

Pieces are removed by matching the length of the row or column where the piece is situated to the number of the piece. The Dollars and Cents that appear on the board are there to make life difficult for the player. They are removed by popping the pieces adjacent to them.

You have limited amount of moves, after which the board will move up one row and the bottom row is filled with Dollars. When this happens the level goes up, and each consecutive level has less moves than the one before(level 1 moves - level).

The game is over when the board is full or a new level is reached when the top row has any game pieces in it, moving them outside the board.

Get rid of the Dollars and start making cents. Only to get rid of them too.
